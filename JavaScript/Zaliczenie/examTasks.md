1. EXAM Scale riddle. With 8 balls, ex. [1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1] get position
   of the “heavy” ball. Indexes are to be chosen at random.
   Use weights comparison only two times.
2. EXAM Create a solution that will tell us what poker set we have.

3. EXAM Write a program that will solve simple sudoku (not only the example below!)
   Start

-------Sem2-------

4. [EXAM] Create a bouncy simulator. Get board from ExampleInput.js.
   Y – when bouncing ball gets in collision with it, redirect the ball to a random direction, other that it came from. After that Y turns into 0
   X – border,
   0 – fields, that the ball can travel through,
   1 – bouncing ball

The program should show how the ball travels and bounces against the walls. Bouncing objects starts in any corner. Assume that 1 and Y positions may vary.
